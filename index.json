[{"categories":null,"contents":" Managing our development projects is very easy nowadays, there are so many services to choose from, some with less or more features, but there is an open source project, self-hosted, with so many features that can be installed in a few minutes and the best part is that we can install it on FreeBSD. The project is called Gitea, which is a software for hosting our projects using Git. It has other collaborative features such as bug tracking, code review, continuous integration, kanban boards, tickets and wikis.\nIn this tutorial we will install Gitea and PostgreSQL on FreeBSD using AppJail Director.\nPre-Steps In my system I have the following configuration:\n/etc/rc.conf (Only options assumed by this article):\n# AppJail appjail_enable=\u0026#34;YES\u0026#34; appjail_dns_enable=\u0026#34;YES\u0026#34; # Recommended if your IP address changes, so that we can seamlessly use the # following IP in our jails. ifconfig_tap0_name=\u0026#34;ajdns\u0026#34; ifconfig_ajdns=\u0026#34;inet 172.0.0.1/32\u0026#34; # DNSMasq dnsmasq_enable=\u0026#34;YES\u0026#34; dnsmasq_conf=\u0026#34;/usr/local/share/appjail/files/dnsmasq.conf\u0026#34; # Enable IP forwarding. gateway_enable=\u0026#34;YES\u0026#34; /usr/local/etc/appjail/appjail.conf:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 EXT_IF=jext ON_IF=jext FREEBSD_VERSION=14.0-RELEASE FREEBSD_ARCH=amd64 IMAGE_ARCH=amd64 ENABLE_DEBUG=0 ENABLE_ZFS=1 SHORTEN_DOMAIN_NAMES=1 DEFAULT_RESOLV_CONF=/usr/local/etc/appjail/resolv.conf /usr/local/etc/appjail/resolv.conf:\nnameserver 172.0.0.1 /etc/pf.conf:\nnat-anchor \u0026#39;appjail-nat/jail/*\u0026#39; nat-anchor \u0026#34;appjail-nat/network/*\u0026#34; rdr-anchor \u0026#34;appjail-rdr/*\u0026#34; Console Output:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 # service appjail-dns status appjail_dns is running as pid 97063. # service dnsmasq status dnsmasq is running as pid 98251. # sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding net.inet.ip.forwarding: 1 # freebsd-version 14.0-RELEASE-p4 # uname -r 14.0-RELEASE-p4 # appjail version 3.0.0.20231220+9468250a2fb7e6f6e6f63a89eb0892e325d1cf83 # appjail-director --version appjail-director, version 0.7.0 # zfs list zroot NAME USED AVAIL REFER MOUNTPOINT zroot 72.1G 531G 24K none # ifconfig ajdns ajdns: flags=8843\u0026lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST\u0026gt; metric 0 mtu 1500 options=80000\u0026lt;LINKSTATE\u0026gt; ether 58:9c:fc:10:8e:0c inet 172.0.0.1 netmask 0xffffffff broadcast 172.0.0.1 groups: tap media: Ethernet 1000baseT \u0026lt;full-duplex\u0026gt; status: no carrier nd6 options=29\u0026lt;PERFORMNUD,IFDISABLED,AUTO_LINKLOCAL\u0026gt; # ifconfig jext jext: flags=1008843\u0026lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; metric 0 mtu 1500 options=4e524bb\u0026lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_MTU,VLAN_HWTAGGING,JUMBO_MTU,VLAN_HWCSUM,LRO,WOL_MAGIC,VLAN_HWFILTER,VLAN_HWTSO,RXCSUM_IPV6,TXCSUM_IPV6,HWSTATS,MEXTPG\u0026gt; ether 00:1b:24:e0:6d:a3 inet 192.168.1.105 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255 media: Ethernet autoselect (100baseTX \u0026lt;full-duplex\u0026gt;) status: active nd6 options=29\u0026lt;PERFORMNUD,IFDISABLED,AUTO_LINKLOCAL\u0026gt; I use the development version of AppJail, so remember the version and the commit when testing AppJail.\nNote\nKeep AppJail and Director synchronized and up-to-date.\nThe virtual network I use is as follows, but nowadays you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about it in many cases as AppJail will create it for you:\n1 2 3 # appjail network list NAME NETWORK CIDR BROADCAST GATEWAY MINADDR MAXADDR ADDRESSES DESCRIPTION ajnet 10.0.0.0 10 10.63.255.255 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.1 10.63.255.254 4194302 AppJail network If you need more details on how to set up the above configuration, please refer to the AppJail documentation:\nGetting Started Configuring Introduction to Virtual Networks DNS Gitea Configuration As described in AppJail-makejails/gitea#basic-usage, we need to pass environment variables as follows:\nEnvironment variables must have the form: GITEA__SECTION_NAME__KEY_NAME.

I just run appjail-director up and Gitea is deployed. But if you enter the URL http://192.168.1.105:3000 on another system, you notice that Gitea does not display anything. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, Gitea is initializing and performing some initial tasks, check the rc script:\n1 2 # appjail service jail gitea gitea status gitea is running as pid 91657. After Gitea is up and running, you can register your account, create a repository and, for example, add your SSH key: click on Profile \u0026amp; Settings \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; SSH / GPG Keys.\nProfile and Settings...\nSSH / GPG Keys\nEphemeral Concept From the Director\u0026rsquo;s home page:\nDirector treats each jail as ephemeral. This does not mean that your jails will not persist after you stop them or your system restarts, what it means is that Director assumes that it is safe to destroy the jails since you have clearly separated the data that needs to persist or you do not need such data to persist.\nEven if our jails are some type of \u0026ldquo;Stateful jails\u0026rdquo;, this does not mean that we can\u0026rsquo;t use them as \u0026ldquo;Ephemeral jails\u0026rdquo;. The idea of having ephemeral jails is very simple, but it has many advantages that are probably better described in another article: data is separated into two types, data that needs to persist and data that does not need to persist. We have already separated the data that needs to persist so if we do the following:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 # appjail-director down -d Starting Director (project:gitea) ... Stopping gitea (gitea) ...

Please keep them up-to-date.\nWhat Are AppJail and AppJail Director? AppJail is a framework that provides preconfigured and self-contained applications, frameworks and software stacks, such as WordPress. Using this tool we will have a package installed inside a jail, a lightweight and isolated environment with any custom configuration our software needs. See also.\nAppJail Director is a complementary tool that help us link individual jails so they can work together using an easy-to-learn YAML file. See also.\nAlthough an optional feature, AppJail has images, a static snapshot of a jail that improves performance by only downloading the image and importing it when needed. Once an image is downloaded, it is cached until the maintainer of that image updates it. Almost all images in the centralized repository take advantage of this feature.\nWhy Use AppJail Director to Run WordPress? You can simply use AppJail to install WordPress and its dependencies, such as MariaDB, but the benefit of using AppJail Director is that you have a single YAML file, which is easy for humans to read. Using this single file we can share volumes and options between jails in a much easier way. Updating them is another benefit as AppJail Director detects when you change a parameter in the file.\nAppJail Director is not a replacement for AppJail, it is just a tool to create and destroy ephemeral jails in a convenient way.\nNote: When using ZFS, AppJail Director will recursively remove the dataset and its references from a jail. Use a copy instead of a snapshot when using AppJail Director.\nDNS The following configuration assumes that you are using DNS. DNS is useful in these cases because we don\u0026rsquo;t need to set up static IP addresses and remember each one, we just need to follow the convention that each jail has a hostname such as \u0026lt;Jail Name\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;Virtual Network\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;Domain\u0026gt;. \u0026lt;Domain\u0026gt; is .appjail unless you have changed it and \u0026lt;Virtual Network\u0026gt; is ajnet unless you have changed it.\nSee AppJail#DNS for details.\nSet Up WordPress Create a new directory named ./wordpress/ and cd into it:\n1 2 mkdir -p ./wordpress/ cd ./wordpress/ Create a file named appjail-director.yml in this folder and add the following contents. Set your passwords for the wp_db_password, mariadb_root_password, and mariadb_password arguments. The password entered for wp_db_password and mariadb_password should be the same.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 options: - virtualnet: \u0026#34;:\u0026lt;random\u0026gt; default\u0026#34; - nat: services: wordpress: makejail: gh+AppJail-makejails/wordpress name: wordpress options: - expose: 80 arguments: - wp_db_name: wordpress - wp_db_user: wpuser - wp_db_password: 123 - wp_db_host: mariadb.ajnet.appjail mariadb: makejail: gh+AppJail-makejails/mariadb name: mariadb arguments: - mariadb_user: wpuser - mariadb_password: 123 - mariadb_database: wordpress - mariadb_root_password: 321 Start your jails:\n1 2 3 4 5 # appjail-director up -p wordpress Starting Director; project ID: wordpress; logs: /root/.local/pipx/venvs/director/director/logs/wordpress/2023-08-23_05h44m11s; Creating wordpress (wordpress) ... Done. Creating mariadb (mariadb) ... Done. Finished: wordpress Note: Using the -p parameter we can set the name of our project, so we can track the jails using this name.\nWe already have WordPress installed, you just have to set up your admin username and password in the web interface.\nVolumes (optional, but recommended): We can use WordPress as a bare metal installation and it only took us a few minutes. Now we can add volumes to our WordPress installation, why?:\nHaving a separate directory for our data is much easier to move to, for example, an SSD. The rest of the data can remain on the HDD. Much easier to make backups of the data. Jails in AppJail are treated as ephemeral, not literally, you can stop the jail or reboot your system and the jails will be there anyway, but what I mean by ephemeral is that you can destroy your jail and as you separate the data you have a new updated services but with the old data. Why not just use volumes the first time? Remember that nullfs(5) is the default volume type as it is used to mount one directory into another, so if we mount an empty directory our jail will have an empty directory as the last directory is stacked in the old directory. We could use mount_unionfs(8) but as its man page says:\nTHIS FILE SYSTEM TYPE IS NOT YET FULLY SUPPORTED (READ: IT DOESN\u0026#39;T WORK) AND USING IT MAY, IN FACT, DESTROY DATA ON YOUR SYSTEM. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. Our plan is as follows: 1. stop the jails so that their services do not write data until we migrate the data from the jail to the host. 2. copy or move the data from the jail to the host. 3. configure appjail-director.yml to use volumes. 4. re-run the jails.\nStop the jails:\n# appjail-director ls -p wordpress wordpress: + wordpress (wordpress) + mariadb (mariadb) # appjail-director down -p wordpress Starting Director; project ID: wordpress; logs: /root/.local/pipx/venvs/director/director/logs/wordpress/2023-08-23_06h15m11s; Stopping wordpress ...

This step is important because mount_nullfs(8) mounts the directories as is.\nConfigure appjail-director.yml:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 options: - virtualnet: \u0026#34;:\u0026lt;random\u0026gt; default\u0026#34; - nat: services: wordpress: makejail: gh+AppJail-makejails/wordpress name: wordpress options: - expose: 80 arguments: - wp_db_name: wordpress - wp_db_user: wpuser - wp_db_password: 123 - wp_db_host: mariadb.ajnet.appjail volumes: - wp-content: /usr/local/www/apache24/data/wp-content mariadb: makejail: gh+AppJail-makejails/mariadb name: mariadb arguments: - mariadb_user: wpuser - mariadb_password: 123 - mariadb_database: wordpress - mariadb_root_password: 321 volumes: - db: /var/db/mysql - db-done: /.mariadb-done volumes: wp-content: device: ./wordpress/wp-content db: device: ./mariadb/db db-done: device: ./mariadb/done options: ro As you can see, there is an empty directory named ./mariadb/done/. The purpose of this directory is to tell Makejail scripts not to reconfigure MariaDB. If we reconfigure MariaDB with old databases, the installation will fail because it probably has a password that the scripts do not know.\nRe-run the jails:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 # appjail-director up -p wordpress Starting Director; project ID: wordpress; logs: /root/.local/pipx/venvs/director/director/logs/wordpress/2023-08-23_13h34m57s; Stopping wordpress ...

Things can get too complicated when you need to transfer your project to another colleague or, even worse, transfer the project to a production environment, and very bad things can happen\u0026hellip; Those problems has been solved by some useful tools, such as those for creating and managing containers.\nAppJail is the framework we will use to create a container with our project: an API using the FastAPI framework. By using this tool we ensure that we can share and reproduce our project to guarantee that it will run smoothly with virtually the same environment as on the host. As a bonus, the host will not be affected.\nThe project We use the following structure to simplify the development of our project:\n1 2 mkdir project/ mkdir project/app/ Note: All files mentioned in this document are relative to the project/ directory.\nNow we create a app/requirements.txt to put the dependencies that our project needs:\nfastapi[all] Note: For simplicitly, we will install FastAPI with optional dependencies and features, but you probably won\u0026rsquo;t need all of them in a production environment. See documentation for details.\nOur app/main.py is only a few lines long:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) async def root(): return {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hello world\u0026#34;} A simple hello world is displayed each time the user makes an HTTP request with the GET method.\nThe Makejail The next step is to create the Makejail.\nINCLUDE gh+AppJail-makejails/python We have included the Makejail from the centralized repository to install Python.\n# Optional, see below for details. INCLUDE options/network.makejail Another Makejail with only the network options we use for this jail. The content is as follows:\nARG network ARG interface=python OPTION virtualnet=${network}:${interface} default OPTION nat Of course, we need the options/ directory beforehand (remember: relative to the project/ directory):\n1 mkdir options/ Another way to achieve the above is to define option by option on the command-line when building the jail as we will see later.\nWORKDIR /app COPY app/ Using WORKDIR we create a directory named /app inside the jail. As we have changed the working directory, COPY is affected and the target directory is relative to that directory, so we can omit the second argument and the files in app/ directory will be copied from the host to the jail. Remember that the / suffix is for copying all the files, not the directory itself.\nCMD pw useradd -n pyapp -d /app -s /bin/sh CMD mkdir -p /app CMD chown -R pyapp:pyapp /app We create a dedicated user named pyapp to run the script with less privileges than root.\nPKG py%{PYTHON_MAJOR}%{PYTHON_MINOR}-pip devel/py-pip is not installed by default, so we install it. We can install pip explicitly with the corresponding python version, but the Makejail for Python provides some build arguments.\nPKG py%{PYTHON_MAJOR}%{PYTHON_MINOR}-wheel PKG rust lang/rust is required by a FastAPI dependency. It is recommended to install devel/py-wheel when installing python dependencies.\nUSER pyapp RUN pip install --user -r requirements.txt We install the dependencies by running pip using the dedicated user.\nSTAGE cmd USER pyapp WORKDIR /app RUN /app/.local/bin/uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 The cmd stage is used to run the python script using appjail run as we will se later. The working directory is reset with each stage, so we need to specify it again. USER is also reset for each stage.\nThe command uvicorn main:app refers to:\nmain: the file main.py (the Python \u0026lsquo;module\u0026rsquo;). app: the object created inside of main.py with the line app = FastAPI(). --reload: make the server restart after code changes. Only use for development. --host: as the default is 127.0.0.1, we need to change to the jail\u0026rsquo;s IP address, but for simplicity, we use 0.0.0.0 to listen on all IP addresses of all interfaces. All of the above instructions in a single file can be seen below:\nINCLUDE gh+AppJail-makejails/python # Optional, see below for details.

As mentioned in previous sections, we can specify option by option on the command-line instead of using options/network.makejail. Of course, remove the instruction that includes that file if you want to use the command-line.\n1 appjail makejail -j pyapp -o virtualnet=\u0026#34;development:pyapp default\u0026#34; -o nat Once the above process is finished, we can run the API:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # appjail run pyapp INFO: Will watch for changes in these directories: [\u0026#39;/app\u0026#39;] INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit) INFO: Started reloader process [93321] using WatchFiles INFO: Started server process [93323] INFO: Waiting for application startup.

This is the case for watchfiles in the FastAPI framework, which requires lang/rust to compile its stuff. This takes a long time depending on your hardware, but there is a simple way to spend less time.\nWe can use the precompiled binaries in the FreeBSD repositories if the dependencies are already ported, so we just have to change our Makejail a bit to do this job.\nINCLUDE gh+AppJail-makejails/python # Optional, see below for details.
