      <description>Managing our development projects is very easy nowadays, there are so many services to choose from, some with less or more features, but there is an open source project, self-hosted, with so many features that can be installed in a few minutes and the best part is that we can install it on FreeBSD. The project is called Gitea, which is a software for hosting our projects using Git. It has other collaborative features such as bug tracking, code review, continuous integration, kanban boards, tickets and wikis.</description>
