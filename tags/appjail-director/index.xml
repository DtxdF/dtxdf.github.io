      <description>Managing our development projects is very easy nowadays, there are so many services to choose from, some with less or more features, but there is an open source project, self-hosted, with so many features that can be installed in a few minutes and the best part is that we can install it on FreeBSD. The project is called Gitea, which is a software for hosting our projects using Git. It has other collaborative features such as bug tracking, code review, continuous integration, kanban boards, tickets and wikis.</description>

      <description>Note
AppJail and Director have evolved to perform the following steps with less effort. Please keep them up-to-date.
What Are AppJail and AppJail Director? AppJail is a framework that provides preconfigured and self-contained applications, frameworks and software stacks, such as WordPress. Using this tool we will have a package installed inside a jail, a lightweight and isolated environment with any custom configuration our software needs. See also.
AppJail Director is a complementary tool that help us link individual jails so they can work together using an easy-to-learn YAML file.</description>
